title: 'Causal Inference and Uplift Modelling: A Review of the Literature'
abstract: 'Uplift modeling refers to the set of techniques used to model the incremental
  impact of an action or treatment on a customer outcome. Uplift modeling is therefore
  both a Causal Inference problem and a Machine Learning one. The literature on uplift
  is split into 3 main approaches - the Two-Model approach, the Class Transformation
  approach and modeling uplift directly. Unfortunately, in the absence of a common
  framework of causal inference and notation, it can be quite difficult to assess
  those three methods. In this paper, we use the Rubin (1974) model of causal inference
  and its modern “econometrics” notation to provide a clear comparison of the three
  approaches and generalize one of them. To our knowledge, this is the first paper
  that provides a unified review of the uplift literature. Moreover, our paper contributes
  to the literature by showing that, in the limit, minimizing the Mean Square Error
  (MSE) formula with respect to a causal effect estimator is equivalent to minimizing
  the MSE in which the unobserved treatment effect is replaced by a modified target
  variable. Finally, we hope that our paper will be of use to researchers interested
  in applying Machine Learning techniques to causal inference problems in a business
  context as well as in other fields: medicine, sociology or economics.'

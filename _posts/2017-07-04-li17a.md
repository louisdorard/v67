title: Scaling Machine Learning as a Service
abstract: Machine learning as a service (MLaaS) is imperative to the success of many
  companies as they need to gain business intelligence from big data. Building a scalable
  MLaaS for mission-critical and real-time applications is a very challenging problem.
  In this paper, we present the scalable MLaaS we built for Uber that operates globally.
  We focus on several scalability challenges. First, how to scale feature computation
  for many machine learning use cases. Second, how to build accurate models using
  global data and account for individual city or region characteristics. Third, how
  to enable scalable model deployment and real-time serving for hundreds of thousands
  of models across multiple data centers. Our technical solutions are the design and
  implementation of a scalable feature computing engine and feature store, a framework
  to manage and train a hierarchy of models as a single logical entity, and an automated
  one-click deployment system and scalable real-time serving service.
